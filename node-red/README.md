## Node-RED flow for demo UI and patch carrier interaction

The flow was created using Node-RED 0.17.5 with Node-RED dashboard

It visualizes some volatile values from a Cybus Connectware
data source and triggers values using MQTT
(simple communication with thermochromic
patch owner resp. her capacitive sensor).
